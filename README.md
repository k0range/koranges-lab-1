# Korange's Lab (Makeshift)
Korange's Lab is a site that collects my small web services, one of which is called Relaytale.

## Technically
Korange's Lab is a monorepo in npm workspace, using Nuxt for the frontend and Hono for the backend. (Authencation by Auth.js)
Hosting is provided by Netlify and Google Cloud Run.

## Relaytale
Relaytale is a site where everyone writes the continuation of a story, one paragraph at a time, in real time. (Submitted to Hackmate YSWS, on HackClub)
The first paragraph will be chosen at random to be unique and imaginative.

## What does "Makeshift" mean?
I was rushing to write code to meet the deadline, and it ended up being pretty awful. I didn't have much time, so I polished it up to a releaseable state (and It's actually works np).

However, this code base makes it difficult to add features (such as adding a small web service), so I'm thinking of doing a major rebuild at some point. Compared to that plan, this is a "Makeshift".
